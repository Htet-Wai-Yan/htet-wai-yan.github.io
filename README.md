# Portfolio Mark II

The previous portfolio was built with bootstrap and added other jQuery frameworks. The UI was written from scratch and I felt a lot less professional although it is well structured. Therefore, I created the __Protfolio Mark II__ hoping that it will provide clean and modern look to the visitors. 

However, This is still the __beta__ version. Therefore, more relevant functionalities and transitions will be added in the future to provide pleasing user experience.

Besides, the Carousel and Project area are dynamically generated usig data file and __async/await__ function giving me easier way to add new projects without needing to copy / paste repeated HTML codes again and again.
